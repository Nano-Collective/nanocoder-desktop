# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents, and anyone else, working in this repository. Keep it current: a pull request that changes the structure, commands or conventions below updates this file too.

## Project Overview

Nanocoder Desktop is an Electron desktop workspace around [Nanocoder](https://github.com/Nano-Collective/nanocoder). It drives Nanocoder over the Agent Client Protocol (`nanocoder --acp`) and adds no agent of its own: Nanocoder owns models, prompts, tools, approvals and chat history.

The project is pre-v0.1. The plan lives in [`planning/`](planning/index.md): start at `planning/index.md`, and see `planning/roadmap.md` for the current phase. How the app looks is in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## Architecture

| Layer | Folder | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Main process | `source/main/` | The only privileged code: windows, the `app://` protocol, session lock-down, IPC handlers, finding and launching Nanocoder |
| Preload | `source/preload/` | Sandboxed, built as CommonJS. Exposes typed functions as `window.desktop`, never `ipcRenderer` |
| Renderer | `source/renderer/` | React, sandboxed, no Node. Receives data, never a capability |
| Shared | `source/shared/` | IPC channel names, error codes, result and data types |

Details are in [`planning/architecture.md`](planning/architecture.md); the security rules are in [`planning/security.md`](planning/security.md).

## Key Files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `source/main/index.ts` | App entry: profile ownership lock, `app://` protocol, CSP, sandbox, navigation and window rules |
| `source/main/lifecycle.ts` | Ready-gated, shutdown-stopped window requests, service disposal and quit guard; supervisor cleanup finishes before the store closes |
| `source/main/security.ts` | Origin checks, renderer file resolution, Content Security Policy |
| `source/main/paths.ts` | Shared native realpath canonicalisation (symlinks and volume case aliases) and component containment |
| `source/main/ipc/handle-request.ts` | Sender check, schema validation and the result shape for every IPC call |
| `source/main/ipc/index.ts` | Registers the IPC handlers |
| `source/main/terminal/`, `source/main/ipc/terminal.ts`, `source/shared/terminal.ts` | Isolated utility-process PTY, main-owned active-project lifecycle, bounded memory-only output and strict typed terminal IPC (`TERM-01` to `TERM-10`) |
| `source/main/terminal/agent-command.ts` | Passive bounded last-command and accepted-option display projection (`TERM-12`), never a terminal or permission capability |
| `source/renderer/terminal-panel.tsx`, `source/renderer/terminal-view.tsx`, `source/renderer/styles/terminal.css` | Token-based xterm bottom dock, explicit lifecycle controls, separate agent display and keyboard/screen-reader access |
| `source/main/browser/`, `source/main/ipc/browser.ts`, `source/shared/browser.ts`, `e2e/browser.e2e.ts` | Main-owned browser view (phases 3.3 and 3.4): a sandboxed `WebContentsView` with a persistent partition per project, no preload, Node or IPC, permissions denied. `origin.ts` is the one origin policy (loopback always, public sites only with the setting, other schemes never) applied to typed addresses, redirects and links; `browser-service.ts` owns navigation and loading state, downloads, profile choice, clearing data and the external open; `profile.ts` and `profiles.ts` map each profile kind to its partition and keep the named profiles and project choices in two main-only settings keys (migration `005`); `external.ts` is the only door to `shell.openExternal` and accepts web addresses only (`BRW-01` to `BRW-09`, `SEC-10`, `SEC-12`, `SEC-16`) |
| `source/main/browser-control/mcp-server.ts`, `source/main/browser-control/status-tool.ts`, `source/main/browser-control/browser-server.acp.ts` | Phase 3.7 browser tool server for Nanocoder sessions: Streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1` with a fresh bearer secret per session (only its digest kept), refusing any `Origin` header, a foreign `Host` and unbounded or batched bodies, and revoked with the session; passed in `mcpServers` only to Nanocoder 1.32.0 or later with `mcpCapabilities.http`. One read-only tool labelled as page data until the phase 3.8 broker (`ACP-22`, `DEC-47`, `BRW-15`, `BRW-17`) |
| `source/main/browser-control/broker.ts`, `source/main/browser-control/page-scripts.ts`, `source/main/browser-control/sensitive.ts`, `e2e/browser-agent.e2e.ts` | Phase 3.8 browser-control broker: nine typed tools on the browser tool server, fixed page scripts run in an isolated world with agent values as JSON data only, real input from main, sensitive-action rules decided in main, agent control on local addresses only and only while the browser is on screen, and data requests and downloads cancelled during an action (`BRW-11` to `BRW-17`, `SEC-13`) |
| `source/main/nanocoder/disabled-tools.ts`, `source/main/store/migrations/006-browser-agent-settings.ts`, `source/main/nanocoder/nanocoder-browser.acp.ts` | Phase 3.10 switch for Nanocoder's own `browser` tool: the `nanocoderBrowserEnabled` setting (off by default), `_meta["nanocoder/disabledTools"]` on new and resumed sessions while it is off, and refusing a session whose echo does not confirm it (`BRW-18`, `DEC-48`) |
| `source/main/browser/agent-policy.ts`, `source/main/browser/site-access.ts` | Phase 3.9 agent rules: local addresses always, public sites only with the setting, `normal` mode and the user's per-site answer (`DEC-50`), desktop approvals for sensitive actions through the supervisor's approval shelf, and pause, interrupt and take control in the browser service (`BRW-12` to `BRW-16`, `SEC-09`, `SEC-11`, `DEC-15`) |
| `source/shared/local-url.ts`, `e2e/browser-links.e2e.ts` | Phase 3.6 localhost address finder (`TERM-05`) shared by the terminal links, the terminal's open button and chat links, and the end-to-end proof including sending the page to the chat (`BRW-10`) |
| `source/renderer/browser-panel.tsx`, `source/renderer/browser-controller.ts`, `source/renderer/use-browser.ts`, `source/renderer/use-modal-open.ts`, `source/shared/browser-address.ts` | The workbench browser tab: address bar, back, forward, reload and stop, origin and security state, the public sites question, profile choice and its data controls, the downloads list, and reporting the viewport so the native view follows it and steps aside for dialogs |
| `source/renderer/terminal-controller.ts`, `source/renderer/use-terminal.ts` | Project-scoped sequenced terminal data, bounded memory, pending actions and stale-result refusal |
| `source/renderer/terminal-output.ts` | Serialised xterm writes and supported screen-reader queue reset on clear and stop |
| `source/renderer/terminal-styles.ts` | Mirrors xterm's generated `<style>` rules into adopted sheets so ANSI colours and the cursor render under the strict style policy |
| `e2e/terminal.e2e.ts`, `planning/terminal.md` | Hidden native teardown, terminal UI, focus, contrast and theme/width screenshots, plus local implementation limits |
| `source/main/ipc/workspace.ts` | Strict workspace request schemas and injectable handlers; absent services return `UNAVAILABLE` |
| `source/main/files/safe-path.ts`, `source/main/files/limits.ts` | The one relative-path validator, contained realpath resolution and post-open identity check, and every bound the file service and ACP reads share (`SEC-03`, `SEC-04`) |
| `source/main/files/file-service.ts`, `source/main/files/encoding.ts` | Lazy one-folder listings, bounded text previews, encoding detection that never rewrites, and the `.git` and outside-link refusals (`FILE-01` to `FILE-04`, `FILE-10`) |
| `source/main/files/watcher.ts`, `source/main/files/editor.ts` | Debounced project watching with a limit fallback, and editor and reveal handoff from known absolute paths (`FILE-05` to `FILE-07`, `DEC-43`) |
| `source/main/files/acp-fs.ts`, `source/main/files/attachments.ts` | Root-checked `fs/read_text_file` answers for Nanocoder and transient prompt attachments (`ACP-11`, `SEC-20`, `FILE-08`, `CHAT-16`) |
| `source/main/files/runtime.ts`, `source/main/ipc/files.ts`, `source/shared/files.ts`, `source/shared/review.ts` | Composition of files, Git, watching and turn tracking; strict file and review IPC; shared contracts |
| `source/main/files/files.acp.ts` | Real pinned Nanocoder with a scripted model: linked and embedded attachments, review comments and `autoCommit` in the turn review (`FILE-08`, `ACP-11`, `GIT-12`) |
| `source/main/git/run.ts` | The only place Git starts: argument array, hardened flags, scrubbed environment and a read-only subcommand allow-list (`GIT-11`, `GIT-14`, `SEC-06`) |
| `source/main/git/locate.ts`, `source/main/git/git-service.ts`, `source/main/git/status-parser.ts` | Absolute Git discovery, cached NUL-delimited status, per-file diffs and tree marks (`GIT-01` to `GIT-04`, `GIT-13`) |
| `source/main/git/turn-tracker.ts`, `source/main/git/review-service.ts` | Last-turn touched labels from edit tool calls and commits made during a turn (`GIT-05`, `GIT-12`) |
| `source/renderer/files-controller.ts`, `source/renderer/review-controller.ts`, `source/renderer/diff-parse.ts` | Lazy tree and review state with stale-answer guards, tree and diff keyboard models, unified-diff parsing |
| `source/renderer/workbench.tsx`, `source/renderer/file-tree.tsx`, `source/renderer/file-preview.tsx`, `source/renderer/review-panel.tsx`, `source/renderer/code-editor.ts` | The files and review panel; CodeMirror loads lazily inside a shadow root so the strict style policy holds |
| `source/renderer/attachments.ts` | Per-thread, in-memory prompt attachments that ride with one message and are then forgotten |
| `source/main/ipc/workspace-services.ts` | Main-only project and thread service contracts |
| `source/main/projects/` | Canonical project selection and relocation, bounded read-only trust summaries, and snapshot-checked native consent |
| `source/main/store/contracts.ts` | Metadata store, repositories and replaceable SQLite driver seam (`DEC-04`) |
| `source/main/store/index.ts` | Opens `userData/desktop.sqlite`, checks integrity, quarantines corruption and stores validated settings/UI state |

| `source/main/store/migrations/` | Numbered, transactional schema upgrades, with a backup before upgrading an existing database |
| `source/main/store/migrations/003-manual-thread-titles.ts` | Main-only boolean for durable manual-title precedence; existing titles are conservatively protected (`CHAT-12`) |
| `source/main/store/migrations/004-thread-execution-identities.ts`, `source/main/store/thread-execution-identities.ts` | Main-only bounded structural turn/execution identities, revision guards and atomic safe run metadata commits |
| `source/main/store/repositories.ts` | Project/thread metadata only, scoped queries, canonical paths and cascade removal |
| `source/main/store/validation.ts` | Allowlisted metadata schemas, including the settings/UI patches shared with IPC |

| `source/main/nanocoder/conformance/`, `source/main/nanocoder/conformance.acp.ts`, `scripts/print-bundled-cli.mjs` | Phase 4.5 ACP conformance: one recorded real `initialize` answer and its gate results per supported Nanocoder version, the `*.acp.ts` test that reads the live answer and (with `NANOCODER_CONFORMANCE_STRICT=1`, set by the bundled CI job) fails on a missing or changed record, and the path of the staged bundled build; re-record with `NANOCODER_RECORD_CONFORMANCE=1` (`ACP-04`, `ACP-21`, `DEC-51`) |
| `source/main/threads/retention.ts`, `source/shared/retention.ts`, `source/main/store/migrations/007-session-retention.ts`, `source/renderer/retention-notice.ts`, `source/renderer/use-retention-warnings.ts`, `e2e/retention.e2e.ts`, `e2e/crash-recovery.e2e.ts` | Phase 4.6: the pinned flag per thread and the limits Nanocoder reports (main-only columns and table), the warning for unpinned threads near Nanocoder's retention in every project, the `DEC-45` view-only wording, the thread list marker, and the end-to-end proofs including an app killed mid-turn (`ACP-17`, `ACP-19`, `CHAT-23`, `DEC-45`) |
| `scripts/lib/supply-chain.mjs`, `planning/security-review.md` | Phase 4.7: the `SEC-18` checks (every action and shared workflow pinned to a commit, Electron one exact version, the pnpm release-age and install-script policy, frozen-lockfile installs) run against the repository in `pnpm test:ava`, and the rule-by-rule and Electron checklist review with scanner results |
| `source/main/nanocoder/abort.ts` | Cancels pending lookups and trust confirmations without allowing late launches |
| `source/main/nanocoder/runtime.ts` | Finds Nanocoder and a Node.js runtime by absolute path: the bundled ones in a packaged build (never `PATH`), the override variables first, `PATH` only in development |
| `scripts/lib/fuses.mjs`, `scripts/smoke-installer.mjs`, `electron-builder.yml` | Phase 4.2 shipped-build hardening: the Electron fuse policy with its reasons (`runAsNode`, `nodeOptions` and `nodeCliInspect` off, asar-only with integrity on), read from the packaged app and proven by behaviour in the packaged smoke test, and the installer round trip (install, launch, uninstall) per platform (`SEC-19`, `REL-05`) |
| `source/main/nanocoder/runtime-check.ts`, `scripts/prepare-runtime.mjs`, `scripts/lib/bundle.mjs`, `scripts/nanocoder-bundle.json`, `bundle/nanocoder/` | Phase 4.1 bundled runtime: the pinned Node and Nanocoder staged into the app's resources with their pins and the committed lock verified, and the packaged smoke test's start-up check and `NODE_OPTIONS` guard (`REL-02`, `REL-04`, `REL-11`, `SEC-05`) |
| `source/main/nanocoder/launch.ts` | Starts Nanocoder with an argument array and no shell |

| `source/main/nanocoder/session-title.ts` | Bounded, allowlisted parsing for main-only Nanocoder title notifications |
| `source/main/threads/session-discovery.ts`, `source/main/nanocoder/session-discovery.acp.ts` | Bounded native exact-root saved-session discovery and pinned real-ACP listing/resume proof (`ACP-18`, `DEC-34`) |
| `source/main/threads/thread-service.ts` | Metadata-first threads, mapped transient events, main-only activity/recovery/detach adapters and separately confirmed history deletion |
| `source/main/threads/project-activity.ts`, `source/renderer/project-activity.ts`, `source/renderer/background-projects.tsx`, `source/renderer/use-project-activity.ts` | Per-project running, approval, finished and failed status from thread states, the rail section for other projects, and its toast; metadata only (`CHAT-22`) |
| `source/main/exit-guard.ts`, `source/main/exit-prompt.ts`, `source/main/activity-notifier.ts`, `e2e/background-turns.e2e.ts` | The question before quitting or closing a window with an unfinished turn (off in hidden test runs), the generic operating system notification and the end-to-end proof (`CHAT-22`) |
| `source/main/threads/project-operations.ts`, `planning/project-operations.md` | Shared branded execution/metadata/confirmation leases, owned thread mutations, active-turn exceptions and preparation/recovery/detach settlement barriers |
| `source/main/controls/`, `planning/model-and-mode-controls.md` | Shared-authority model offers, memory-only pending/live modes, cancel-default native yolo consent and owned hooks; preserve their wiring in phase 1.8 composition |
| `source/main/nanocoder/control-options.ts`, `source/main/nanocoder/session-controls.ts` | Bounded known offers kept per session (shared across sessions only when Nanocoder lacks `perSessionModel`, `DEC-51`; `project-controls.ts` follows the selected thread), acknowledgement-gated modes and process-wide config uncertainty |
| `source/main/nanocoder/trust.ts` | Reads Nanocoder's trust refusals and runs the short trust launch (`DEC-30`) |
| `source/main/nanocoder/trust-preflight.ts` | Isolated fail-closed ACP trust-check admission for provisional 1.31.x overrides, with identity-keyed memory-only verdicts |
| `source/main/nanocoder/open-project.ts` | Connects, asks before trusting a folder, then opens or resumes a session in the starting mode |
| `source/main/nanocoder/protocol-stream.ts` | Reads stdout as ACP only; anything else ends the connection |
| `source/main/nanocoder/stderr-ring.ts` | Bounded, redacted, in-memory ring for Nanocoder's stderr |
| `source/main/nanocoder/permissions.ts` | Holds each permission request until the user answers; only an option Nanocoder offered counts |
| `source/main/nanocoder/turn-events.ts`, `source/main/nanocoder/turn-metadata.ts` | Normalises SDK stream updates and allowlisted vendor metadata without adding capabilities |
| `source/main/nanocoder/subagent-display.ts`, `source/shared/subagents.ts` | Bounded display-only delegation and permission source hints, never routing or answer authority |
| `source/main/store/agent-runs.ts`, `source/main/nanocoder/subagent-runs.ts` | Metadata-only repository and forkable passive observer; ThreadService owns atomic live/replay association |

| `source/renderer/transcript.ts`, `source/renderer/stream-batcher.ts` | Ordered immutable transcript patches and cancellable 16ms renderer batching |
| `source/renderer/conversation-stream.tsx`, `source/renderer/agent-markdown.tsx`, `source/renderer/stream-commands.tsx` | U.4 stream rows, isolated inert Markdown and advertised-command draft suggestions |
| `source/renderer/stream-announcements.tsx` | A11Y-04/05 clock-injected lifecycle/finished-response speech and one persistent modal-aware polite live node |
| `source/renderer/composer.tsx`, `source/renderer/project-controls.ts`, `source/renderer/use-project-controls.ts` | Mounted multiline composer, native mode/default disclosure and scoped acknowledged project-control state; no renderer live-mode cache |

| `planning/subagents.md` | Phase 1.10 source limits, SUB-05 composition contract and subagent verification gaps |
| `source/renderer/recovery-tools.tsx` | Compact process recovery and captured diagnostics review/export controls |
| `source/renderer/app-shell.tsx`, `source/renderer/styles/app-shell.css` | Compact chronological navigation, constrained chat and optional workbench/bottom slots; open workbench owns the canvas at 840px and below |
| `source/renderer/thread-rail.tsx`, `source/renderer/thread-rail-model.ts` | Plain-prop U.3 chronological groups, state glyphs and thread selection; metadata actions open from the header thread actions dialog; presentation uses `styles/threads.css` |
| `source/renderer/thread-recovery-notice.tsx` | Plain-prop CHAT-09 missing-history metadata/actions and explicit same-thread retry; view-only keeps the composer hidden |
| `source/renderer/thread-composer-state.ts` | App-only draft visibility/editability projection; runState, not reason presence, distinguishes retryable and view-only |
| `source/renderer/session-import-controller.ts`, `source/renderer/use-session-imports.ts`, `source/renderer/session-import-list.tsx` | Separately scoped metadata-only import offers, stale-result guards and plain-props native actions; no automatic selection or prompt |

| `source/renderer/thread-controller.ts` | Scoped thread metadata, snapshot/open bridge calls, isolated project/chat sequences and stale async/disposal guards |
| `source/renderer/thread-stream.ts` | Per-thread transient sequence guards, snapshot-prefix replacement and buffered live delivery; separate from project metadata sequencing |
| `source/renderer/thread-workspace.ts`, `source/renderer/use-threads.ts`, `source/renderer/thread-conversations.ts` | Live scoped workspace composition, memory-only drafts and authoritative transient terminal prefixes |
| `planning/threads.md` | Phase 1.5 ownership, legacy protection twins, selected-glyph ink rule and deferred resume work |
| `source/renderer/supervisor-state.ts` | Project-scoped, sequenced ACP badge state; never infers readiness from a connect result |

| `source/renderer/recent-projects.tsx`, `source/renderer/trust-feedback.tsx`, `source/renderer/project-refresh.ts` | Plain-prop project controls, trust feedback and sequenced recents refresh; `use-projects.ts` owns bridge calls and read-generation guards |
| `source/shared/project-events.ts` | Strict ID/sequence-only recents invalidation schema and preload event-variant filter; no new IPC method or channel |
| `scripts/generate-design-tokens.mjs` | Generates committed CSS custom properties from `DESIGN.md`; the adjacent spec rejects drift |
| `planning/ui-foundations.md` | Theme switching, keyboard-focus QA and the proposed Markdown renderer |

| `planning/ui-overlays.md` | Overlay commands, keyboard rules and notification verification |
| `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`, `scripts/generate-notices.mjs`, `scripts/lib/notices.mjs`, `scripts/notice-policy.json` | Phase 4.3 third-party notices: the committed desktop file is generated, never hand-edited, from the packages the build bundles; the runtime's is generated at packaging from the staged tree; the policy lists accepted licences and the one recorded exception; the Notices CI job and the packaged smoke test fail when they are stale or missing (`REL-06`) |
| `source/main/nanocoder/capabilities.ts` | Records `initialize` capabilities and builds feature gates with reasons; extensions need safe probes |
| `source/main/nanocoder/fixtures/` | A fake `nanocoder --acp`, a scripted model provider and test helpers, including the setup shared by the `*.acp.ts` tests |
| `source/shared/ipc.ts` | Channels, error codes and IPC types |
| `source/shared/thread-replay.ts` | Strict optional display-only replay markers and readiness refusal copy; epochs never enter a request or authorise an action |

| `e2e/streaming.e2e.ts` | Fake stream cadence, ordered rendering, input/scroll/frame response, safe resources and multi-width stream QA |
| `e2e/replay-gates.e2e.ts` | Mounted replay success/failure refusals, editable unqueued drafts and 200-message post-replay usability timing (`PERF-03`) |
| `e2e/session-import.e2e.ts` | Both-theme keyboard saved-session import, no ACP/selection/draft side effects, explicit same-session resume and project ownership |
| `e2e/session-import-focus.e2e.ts`, `e2e/qa/session-import-focus-harness.ts` | Mounted pending-import focus guards (a control outside the import list, and scope) and preserved keyboard-only return in both themes |
| `e2e/stream-announcements.e2e.ts`, `e2e/qa/stream-announcement-harness.ts` | Isolated fake-clock speech, accessibility-tree/modal-host checks and lifecycle/approval focus checks |
| `e2e/subagents.e2e.ts`, `e2e/qa/subagent-harness.ts` | Fake delegation/approval/cancel, card focus and stop-owner/refusal tests; `subagents.acp.ts` checks real pinned ACP |
| `e2e/qa/launch.ts` | Test-only launcher for browser-driven QA with fake Nanocoder and a separate profile in `.qa/` |
| `e2e/qa/approval-harness.ts` | Browser-only component fixture for failed answers and atomic same-size approval queue replacement |

| `scripts/fetch-node-sidecar.mjs`, `scripts/measure-runtime.mjs` | Download and verify the sidecar; measure both runtimes (phase G.6) |
| `electron.vite.config.ts`, `electron-builder.yml` | Build and packaging |
| `.github/workflows/desktop-checks.yml` | Local CI jobs beside the shared `pr-checks` |

```

`NANOCODER_DESKTOP_CLI` and `NANOCODER_DESKTOP_NODE` point the app at a specific Nanocoder `dist/cli.js` and Node.js runtime (absolute paths).

## Security Rules

These hold in every change:

- Renderers stay sandboxed with context isolation and no Node. The preload exposes typed functions only.
- Every IPC handler goes through `registerHandler`, with a `zod` `strictObject` schema. It returns an `IpcResult`; throw `IpcFailure` for a specific error code.
- The shipped build has `runAsNode`, `nodeOptions` and `nodeCliInspect` off, and the packaged smoke test fails if any is on or if the app honours `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` or `NODE_OPTIONS`. End-to-end tests drive an unpacked Electron, where those fuses stay on for Playwright (`SEC-19`).
- Processes start from an absolute path with an argument array and `shell: false`. No `PATH` lookup at launch, and never a binary from the project's own folder. A packaged app runs the Node and Nanocoder it ships and never searches `PATH`, unless the user sets `NANOCODER_DESKTOP_CLI` or `NANOCODER_DESKTOP_NODE`.
- Nanocoder's stdout carries ACP only: a line that is not a JSON-RPC frame ends the connection. Its stderr is redacted into a bounded in-memory ring, and only Nanocoder's own `[nanocoder]` message reaches the UI.
- Nanocoder's directory trust is recorded only by the trust launch right after the user confirms (`DEC-30`). No `--trust-directory`, no `NANOCODER_TRUST_DIRECTORY` on any other launch, and an inherited one is dropped.
- Permission requests are answered only by the user, from the main process: the renderer sends a request id and an option id, and both are checked against what Nanocoder offered. With no handler, a request is answered as cancelled, never allowed (`ACP-10`).
- While Nanocoder's own browser is off in settings (the default), every new and resumed session on Nanocoder 1.32.0 or later asks Nanocoder to turn its `browser` tool off, and a session whose echo does not name it is refused (`DEC-48`).
- Every Nanocoder session gets its mode with `session/set_mode` before its first prompt, checked against `availableModes`. A thread takes no prompt until that succeeds, and `yolo` is never restored (`DEC-31`).
- Sensitive browser actions by the agent are approved only by the user, with a card in the chat whose turn asked; agent control of public sites needs the setting, `normal` mode and the user's answer for that site (`DEC-15`, `DEC-50`).
- The desktop's browser tool server listens on `127.0.0.1` only, refuses any request that carries an `Origin` header, and accepts only a live secret issued for one session of one project. The secret travels in that session's ACP request, never in the environment, and is revoked when the session ends (`DEC-47`).
- Paths are canonicalised and checked to stay inside their root before use.
- Chat messages, file contents, tool results and secrets are never written to disk or logs. Redacted stderr stays in memory unless the user reviews that exact captured snapshot in main and chooses an export destination.
- The app renderer loads nothing remote and keeps its strict Content Security Policy.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Biome formats and lints (tabs, single quotes, 80 columns). Run `pnpm format`.
- Text files check out with LF on every platform (`.gitattributes`); parsers still accept CRLF input.
- Strict TypeScript. Import from `source/` through the `@/` alias.
- Comments are rare: one line, only where the reason is not obvious.
- Docs and UI text follow the [Brand Guidelines](https://docs.nanocollective.org/collective/organisation/brand): British spelling, no em dashes in docs, no marketing language.
- Ownership is the Nano Collective core team; docs name no individual owner.

## Testing

- Logic and security code (store, supervisor, trust, IPC, permissions, events, transcript) is test first: write one small failing test for the next behaviour from its requirement ID, see it fail for the right reason, write just enough code to pass, then refactor with the tests green.
- A bug fix starts with a test that shows the bug and fails.
- Pure layout and styling may be tested after, with e2e tests, screenshots and accessibility checks.
- Unit tests are AVA `.spec.ts` files beside the code, run in plain Node. Keep logic in modules that do not import Electron, so it can be tested.
- A security rule needs a test that proves the refusal, not only the happy path.
- Tests never sleep for a fixed time; they wait for an event.
- End-to-end tests live in `e2e/`. ACP integration tests are `*.acp.ts`; they keep Nanocoder's config in a temporary folder, use a scripted model provider (no API key) and need a Nanocoder build with the ACP trust check.
- Every end-to-end and QA launch uses `e2e/qa/electron.ts` and a temporary `--user-data-dir`. Routine tests stay hidden and never take native focus or show a macOS Dock icon. The development-only `--nanocoder-e2e-hidden` switch is ignored by packaged apps. For hidden development Linux/Windows runs only, `e2e/qa/hidden-frame-sink.ts` consumes a 1×1 CDP screencast to avoid Chromium's undrawn-frame throttle; frames are immediately acknowledged and discarded in memory, never logged or saved, and capture stops before app close. macOS uses no frame sink. Product scheduling is unchanged. Hidden runs also skip the question before quitting with an unfinished turn and every operating system notification; set `NANOCODER_E2E_EXIT_PROMPT=1` only for a test of that question. CDP emulates page activation only; DOM focus, `:focus-visible`, keyboard input and focus-return assertions remain real. Use `NANOCODER_E2E_VISIBLE=1 pnpm test:e2e` or `NANOCODER_E2E_VISIBLE=1 pnpm qa:launch` only for deliberate native-focus or screen-reader QA.
- Coverage stays at or above 80% of lines.
- UI tokens are generated, not edited by hand. The root `data-theme="light"` switches to light; dark is the default. See `planning/ui-foundations.md` for theme, focus, reduced-motion and contrast QA.
- For visual QA, run `pnpm build`, then `pnpm qa:launch` and `agent-browser connect 9333`. The folder picker and trust dialog are stubbed only in the test launcher. Save fake-fixture screenshots and logs under `.qa/`, never real conversation content. Stop the printed launcher PID when finished. The launcher is type-checked by `tsconfig.e2e.json`, discovered by Knip through the package script and excluded from packaging.

## AI Coding Assistance Notes

- Before changing behaviour, read `planning/index.md`, the relevant file in `planning/features/` and `planning/decisions.md`. A change to a decision updates `planning/decisions.md` in the same pull request.
- Work one roadmap phase at a time and cite its requirement IDs (for example `ACP-01`).
- Commit messages follow the NC convention: `feat:`, `fix:`, `mod:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, lowercase, imperative, no trailing full stop.
- `DESIGN.md` belongs to the designer. Do not change its visual decisions.
- Run `pnpm test:all` before finishing.
