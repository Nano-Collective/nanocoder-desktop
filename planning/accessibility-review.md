# Accessibility review (phase 4.9)

The keyboard and assistive technology review of chat, files, review, terminal and browser: what is proved by an automated test, what only a person with a screen reader can prove, and what the review found. The rules are `A11Y-01` to `A11Y-06` in [`testing-strategy.md`](testing-strategy.md#accessibility-targets), with `CHAT-18`, `FILE-11` and `TERM-11` for the areas.

## What is proved, by area

Test paths start with `e2e/` unless they are under `source/`. The new sweep is `e2e/accessibility.e2e.ts`, with its logic and failing examples in `e2e/qa/accessibility.ts` and `accessibility.spec.ts`.

| Area | `A11Y-01` keyboard, no trap | `A11Y-02` focus order and return | `A11Y-03` name, role and state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat | The sweep tabs forward and back 40 times with no trap. `milestone-exit-checks.e2e.ts` runs the project, palette and approval journey by keyboard | No positive tab index anywhere (the sweep). Approvals take focus and return it (`milestone-exit-checks`, `subagents.e2e.ts`, `approval-requests.spec.ts`) | The sweep reads Chromium's accessibility tree and fails on any unnamed control. `milestone-exit-checks` checks states |
| Files | `files.e2e.ts` ("SP-07 FILE-11 the tree is fully operable from the keyboard with tree semantics"), the sweep | The sweep, `files.e2e.ts` | The sweep, tree roles and expanded state in `files.e2e.ts` |
| Review | The sweep; the diff keyboard model is unit tested (`diff-parse.spec.ts`, `review-controller.spec.ts`) | The sweep | The sweep (filters, file entries and the comment form are named) |
| Terminal | "TERM-02/04/06/11 mounted terminal types, escapes, restarts, clears and stops without trapping focus" (`terminal.e2e.ts`). The sweep uses the documented key whenever focus enters the terminal | Focus returns to the "focus your terminal" button after the escape key | The sweep. The new `TERM-11` test checks the escape key is shown on screen and in `aria-keyshortcuts` |
| Browser | The sweep. The address bar, back, forward, reload and the profile picker are native controls | The sweep | The sweep (address, go, profile picker, the two settings checkboxes) |
| Dialogs | Escape closes each | Palette, shortcuts, projects and thread actions return focus to their opener (`accessibility.e2e.ts`, `cross-dialog-focus.e2e.ts`, `palette-focus-editing.e2e.ts`) | Each dialog is swept |

`A11Y-04` and `A11Y-05` (announcements, and streaming at a polite rate) are proved for chat by `stream-announcements.e2e.ts` and `stream-announcements.spec.ts`: a clock-injected live region, one persistent polite node, no focus move, failure and cancellation distinct. They are not proved for what a real screen reader says, which is the manual protocol below.

Each check was shown to fail when it should. The sweep has failing examples (an unnamed button and text field, a positive tab index, an empty area) and the live-page tests inject those violations and require them to be reported. A pass therefore means the areas were reached and inspected.

## What the review found

| Finding | Result |
|---|---|
| The chat composer, the form around the main input, was exposed as a landmark with no name. It is the most used control in the app | Fixed: it is named "composer", and not "message composer", because the text box is labelled "message" and a second label containing that word makes label lookups by "Message" ambiguous |
| The form for adding a browser profile had no name | Fixed: "new browser profile" |
| Everything else the sweep covers already had a name, a role and a working keyboard path, with no keyboard trap and no forced tab order | No change |

## What only a person can prove

- **`A11Y-04` and `A11Y-05` as heard.** The tests prove what is sent to the live region and when, not that VoiceOver, NVDA or Orca read it at a sensible pace.
- **`A11Y-06`.** The screen reader on each platform completing `SP-03`, `SP-04`, `SP-07` and `SP-08`, including reading a file or a diff past the first screen, since CodeMirror renders only the visible part. The protocol is in [`screen-reader-protocol.md`](screen-reader-protocol.md). No run has been done, and none is claimed here.
- **Orca with Electron** is the open question the testing strategy already names. The first Linux run will show.

## Not covered

- Colour contrast is covered by the contrast tests in `e2e/qa/ui-contrast.ts`, not this review.
- Zoom and reflow at large text sizes, and high contrast modes of the operating system, were not tested.
- The sweep reads Chromium's accessibility tree. Other platforms' accessibility APIs build on it, but a tree that is right in Chromium is not proof for each of them.
